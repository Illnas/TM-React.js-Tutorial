React.js Tutorial by Traversy Media 


Since I finished freeCodeCamp lessons on React.js I decided to do a YT tutorial by Traversy Media.
And, am I glad I have done that! Even before when I first did lessons on freeCodeCamp on React.js, I 
was unable to understand most concept. Reason was quite simple; I have not seen it being used beside 
in that lesson. Let's not forget about the fact that most lessons for React.js have weird order in which you learn 
concepts (solution includes this.props which gets explained in next lesson, is by far the most weirdest example).

Do I understand concepts done in this project? Mostly. But all of that will be learned better when you actually
do some projects with React.js. And next thing I will do is 2 projects on fCC with React.js and with git workflow
that I learned from TOP(The Odin Project) lessons.

See ya in next project!
